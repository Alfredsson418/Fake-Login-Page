# Fake-Login-Page

These websites is copied and repurposed into a cybersecurity project of mine, to show how easy it is to create your own copy of a website to use it for phishing attacks[^1].

# Gullmarsgymnasiet
My schools wi-fi login page pop up everytime when we try to log into the schools wifi, so what I did was to copy the source code to that website and repurposed it would work with flask.

# Google
Another idea i had was to copy the google login page, with animations and all that.

## Other info
Note that the google website is made entirely by myself from the ground up but the gullmarsgymnasiet website is **copied** source code (html, css and images, not the python code) so credit goes to them.
The picures used on the websites is **not** made by myself and credit goes to respective parts.
I do not own any of there brands, and the idea was not to do anything bad to these brand, this was just a school project about how easy it is to replicate webpages.
I also do not condone any bad behavior on the internet, including using these websites for real life phishing attacks or any other type of attacks.
